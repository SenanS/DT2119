# Natural Language Processing Projects 
Labs completed for Speech and Speaker Recognition, KTH 2020.

### Lab 1 - Feature Extraction
Step by step implementation of Mel Filterbank and MFCC features, 
correlation between these features was evaluated & utterances were
 compared with Dynamic Time Warping.


### Lab 2 - HMMs with Gaussian Emissions 
Algorithms for the evaluation and decoding of Hidden Markov Models
implemented, this implementation was used to perform isolated word 
recognition & algorithms for training Gaussian HMMs were implemented.


### Lab 3 - Phoneme Recognition with Deep Neural Networks
Used predefined Gaussian-emission HMM phonetic models, to create time aligned phonetic
transcriptions of the TIDIGITS database. 
A DNN model for phoneme recognition was trained using Keras and evaluated on a frame-by-frame recognition score.
